# 🚴‍♂️ BikeDekho – Bike Sales Analysis

## 📌 Project Workflow  

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Removed duplicate values using **Conditional Formatting** and the **Remove Duplicates** option.  
- Handled missing values by replacing them with **0, average, or median values** as appropriate.  
- Ensured data accuracy and reliability for further analysis.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Performed using **Pivot Tables** to summarize large datasets.  
- Compared attributes like **gender, income, marital status, occupation, and education** to identify patterns.  

### 3. Data Visualization  
- Converted insights into meaningful charts:  
  - **Bar & Column Charts** → Income ranges, education, occupation.  
  - **Pie Charts** → Proportion of sales among different demographics (e.g., homeowners vs renters).  
- Simplified insights for clear storytelling.  

### 4. Dashboard Creation  
- Built an **interactive dashboard in Excel** with:  
  - **KPIs at the top**  
  - **Charts in the middle**  
  - **Detailed breakdowns at the bottom**  
- Added **Slicers** for dynamic filtering by gender, region, and marital status.
